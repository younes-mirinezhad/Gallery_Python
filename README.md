# Gallery_Python
Sample Gallery in Python
Using Python, PySide6, Qt, QML, OpenCV

----------------------------------
In this repository, I prepared a sample to use QAbstractListModel and QQuickPaintedItem in python.

### QAbstractListModel
To use as an input model for ListView or GridView and link python lists to QML objects.

### QQuickPaintedItem
To prepare an image and show that inside QML pages.

I used OpenCV as the default option to prepare images, but I put there another sample code without using OpenCV.
